<p>
  In route planning, the objective is to find the best way to get from point A to point B (think Google Maps).
  In this homework, we will build on top of the classic shortest path problem to allow for more powerful queries. For
  example, not only will you be able to explicitly ask for the shortest path from the Gates Building to Coupa Cafe at Green Library,
  but you can ask for the shortest path from Gates back to your dorm, stopping by the package center,
  gym, and the dining hall (in any order!) along the way.
</p>

<p>
  We will assume that we have a <i>map</i> of a city (e.g., Stanford) consisting of a set of <i>locations</i>.
  Each location has:
  <ol>
    <li>a unique label (e.g., 6608996258),</li>
    <li>a (latitude, longitude) pair specifying where the location is (e.g., 37.4299866, -122.175519), and</li>
    <li>a set of <i>tags</i> which describes the type of location (e.g., amenity=food).</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  There are a set of <i>connections</i> between pairs of locations; each connection has a <i>distance</i> (in meters),
  and can be traversed in both directions (if the distance from A to B is 100 meters, then the distance from B to A is
  also 100 meters).
</p>

<p>
  There are two city maps that you'll be working with: a grid map (<code>createGridMap</code>) and a map of
  Stanford (<code>createStanfordMap</code>), which is derived from
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">Open Street Maps</a>.
</p>


<p>
  We've created a LaTeX template <a href="../../with-prompt-templates/hw3-route-template.zip">here</a> for you to use that contains the prompts for each question.

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Grid City</div>

<p>
  Consider an infinite city consisting of locations $(x,y)$ where $x, y$ are integers.
  From each location $(x,y)$, one can go east, west, north, or south. 
  These movements are what we refer to as ‘actions’. 
  Specifically, an action is a change in the (x, y) coordinates: (+1, 0) represents moving east, (-1, 0) 
  represents moving west, (0, +1) represents moving north, and (0, -1) represents moving south.</p>
<p>You start at $(0,0)$ and want to go to $(m, n)$, where $m, n \geq 0$.
  We can define the following search problem to capture this:
  <ul>
    <li>$s_\text{start} = (0,0)$</li>
    <li>$\text{Actions}(s) = \{ (+1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, +1), (0, -1) \}$</li>
    <li>$\text{Succ}(s, a) = s + a$</li>
    <li>$\text{Cost}((x,y), a) = 1 + \max(x, 0)$ (i.e., it is more expensive as $x$ increases)</li>
    <li>$\text{IsEnd}(s) = \mathbf{1}[s = (m,n)]$</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup" id="1a">
  What is the minimum cost of reaching location $(m,n)$ (note that $m,n \geq 0$) starting from location $(0,0)$ in the above city? Describe one possible path achieving the minimum cost.  Is it unique (i.e., are there multiple paths that achieve the minimum cost)?
  <div class="expected">Provide an expression for the minimum cost. In addition, please provide 1 - 2 sentences describing one possible minimum cost path and state whether it is unique.</div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="1b">
  How will Uniform Cost Search (UCS) behave on this problem? Mark the following as true or false:
  <ol>
    <li>UCS will never terminate because the number of states is infinite.</li>
    <li>UCS will return the minimum cost path and explore only locations between $(0,0)$ and $(m,n)$; that is, $(x,y)$ such that $0 \le x \le m$ and $0 \le y \le n$.</li>
    <li>UCS will return the minimum cost path and explore only locations whose past costs are less than or equal to the minimum cost from $(0,0)$ to $(m,n)$.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="expected">T/F for each subpart.</div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="1c">
  Now consider running UCS on an arbitrary graph. Mark the following as true or false:
  <ol>
    <li>If you add a connection between two locations, the minimum cost cannot go up.</li>
    <li>If you make the cost of an action from some state small enough (possibly negative), that action will show up in the path returned by UCS.</li>
    <li>If you increase the cost of each action by 1, the minimum cost path does not change (even though its cost does).</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="expected">T/F for each subpart.</div>
</li>

</ol>

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Finding Shortest Paths</div>

<p>
  We first start out with the problem of finding the shortest path from a <i>start location</i>
  (e.g., the Gates Building) to some end location. In Google Maps, you can only specify a specific end location
  (e.g., Coupa Cafe at Green Library).
  <br/><br/>
  In this problem, we want to give the user the flexibility of specifying <i>multiple</i> possible end
  locations by specifying a set of "tags" (e.g., so you can say that you want to go to <i>any</i> place with food versus
  a specific location like Tresidder).
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="2a">
    Implement <code>ShortestPathProblem</code> so that given a <code>startLocation</code> and <code>endTag</code>,
    the minimum cost path corresponds to the shortest path from <code>startLocation</code> to <i>any</i> location that
    has the <code>endTag</code>.
  <p>
    In particular, you need to implement <code>startState()</code>, <code>isEnd(state)</code>,
    <code>actionSuccessorsAndCosts(state)</code>. For Problems 2-4, our action space is the set of all named locations, 
    where a named location represents a transition from the current location to that new location. Note: please read 
    the class definitions and methods in <code>util.py</code> (aside from PriorityQueue) for details, as well as the details of the CityMap class in 
    <code>mapUtil.py</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall the separation between search problem (modeling) and search algorithm (inference).
    You should focus on modeling (defining the <code>ShortestPathProblem</code>); the default search algorithm,
    <code>UniformCostSearch</code> (UCS), is implemented for you in <code>util.py</code>
  </p>
  <div class="expected">An implementation of the <code>ShortestPathProblem</code> class.</div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="2b">
  Run <code>python mapUtil.py &gt; readableStanfordMap.txt</code> to write a (long-ish) file of the possible locations on
  the Stanford map along with their tags.
  Each tag is a <code>[key]=[value]</code>.  Here are some examples of keys:
  <ul>
    <li><code>landmark</code>: Hand-defined landmarks (from <code>data/stanford-landmarks.json</code>)</li>
    <li><code>amenity</code>: Various amenity types (e.g., "parking_entrance", "food")</li>
    <li><code>parking</code>: Assorted parking options (e.g., "underground")</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Choose a starting location and end tag (perhaps that's relevant to your daily life) and implement
    <code>getStanfordShortestPathProblem()</code> to create a search problem. Then, run
    <code>python grader.py 2b-custom</code> to generate <code>path.json</code>. Once generated, run
    <code>python visualization.py</code> to visualize it (opens in browser).
    Try different start locations and end tags.
    Pick two settings corresponding to the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A start location and end tag that produced new insight into traveling around campus.
        Describe whether the system was useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        A start location and end tag where the minimum cost path found isn't desirable.
        Is this due to incorrect modeling assumptions (e.g. missing tags/paths, inaccurate locations/distances)? Explain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    You should feel free to add new landmarks. If you are not familiar with the Stanford campus, please feel free to use
    the <a href="https://campus-map.stanford.edu/">Campus Map website</a> to learn more about buildings, amenities, and paths around campus.
  </p>
  <div class="expected">
    A screenshot of the visualization of your two solutions as well as i) one or more sentences describing something interesting you've learned
    about traveling (around campus, or elsewhere) and ii) something incorrect about either the map or modeling assumptions (such a landmark being out of place, etc.).
  </div>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="2c">
  Your system now allows anyone to find the shortest path between any pair of locations on campus. By shortening
  their travel distance, it promises to optimize travel efficiency.  But, there might be issues when a large fraction of the

  <p>
    In particular, what <i>negative externalities</i> might result from this system being widely deployed? Please refer to these
    brief articles for inspiration:

  </p>
  <p>
    Discuss the impact of these externalities on users of your system and other people. Remember that these sorts of problems
    often arise from the mismatch between the real world and one's model of it.
    What are potential ways you could reduce this mismatch?

  <div class="expected">
    Provide 3-5 sentences describing (a) two externalities (one for users of the route-planning system and

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Finding Shortest Paths with Unordered Waypoints</div>

<p>
  Let's introduce an even more powerful feature: unordered waypoints! In Google Maps, you can specify an ordered
  sequence of waypoints that a path must go through – for example, going from point A to point X to point Y to point B,
  where [X, Y] are "waypoints" (such as a gas station or a friend's house).
</p>
<p>
  However, we want to consider the case where the waypoints are <i>unordered</i>: {X, Y}, so that both A &rarr; X &rarr; Y &rarr; B
  and A &rarr; Y &rarr; X &rarr; B are allowed. Moreover, X, Y, and B are each specified by a tag like in Problem 2 (e.g.,
  <code>amenity=food</code>).
</p>
<p>
  This is a neat feature if you think about your day-to-day life; you might be on your way home after a long day, but
  need to stop by the package center, Tresidder to grab a bite of food, and the bookstore to buy some notebooks. Having
  the ability to get a short, quick path that hits all these stops might be really convenient (rather than searching
  over the various waypoint orderings yourself).
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="3a">
  Implement <code>WaypointsShortestPathProblem</code> so that given a <code>startLocation</code>, set of
  <code>waypointTags</code>, and an <code>endTag</code>, the minimum cost path corresponds to the shortest path from
  <code>startLocation</code> to a location with the <code>endTag</code>, such that all of <code>waypointTags</code> are
  covered by some location in the path (potentially including the <code>startLocation</code>).
  <br/>
  Note that a single location can be used to satisfy multiple tags.
  <p>
    Like in Problem 2, you need to implement <code>startState()</code>, <code>isEnd(state)</code>, and
    <code>actionSuccessorsAndCosts(state)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many ways to implement this search problem, so you should think carefully about how to design your
    <code>State</code>. We want to optimize for a compact state space so that search is as efficient as possible.
  </p>

  <div class="expected">

  Ride sharing companies use route-finding systems similar to the one you built in this problem to route their drivers. However, 
  these systems have been criticized for using exploitative behavioral nudges. For example, a
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/technology/uber-drivers-psychological-tricks.html" target="_blank">
    New York Times article
  </a>
  reported how one app uses “forward dispatch,” a feature that dispatches a new ride to a driver before the current one ends, 
  to constantly keep drivers busy. This makes it more difficult for drivers to take breaks.
  
  <p>
  We want you to discuss how these companies could implement better labor practices, finding a way to use the unordering waypoints
  feature to balance company goals with the protection of driver interests. Specifically, we want you to think about ways 
  your new unordered waypoints feature could help drivers in their working experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
  What waypoints could you include from one drop-off location to the next pick-up location to improve the driver experience? 
  What information about drivers would you need to determine appropriate waypoints?
  </p>
  <p>
  Note, however, that the unordered waypoints feature is an example of a dual use technology. 
  For more, refer to the module on dual use technologies to help answer this question 
  (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbzdQ8nmGHsKLLL838uuBPoiEdb6ICnt/view?usp=sharing">video</a> and <a href="https://stanford-cs221.github.io/autumn2024-extra/modules/search/externalities-and-dual-use-technologies.pdf">pdf</a>).
  
  Thus, we also want you to answer: What are some ways that a company could use this waypoints feature to increase profits 
  at the expense of driver health? What are any downsides in collecting the appropriate information you need to recommend the waypoints?
  </p>
  <div class="expected">
    Provide 3-5 sentences describing (a) the waypoints you would include to improve the driver experience, 
    (b) at least one dimension of drivers' identity that could inform selection of waypoints, and

    harming the driver experience or driver health.

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 4: Speeding up Search with A*</div>

<p>
  In this problem, we will explore how to speed up search by reducing the number of
  states that need to be expanded using various A* heuristics.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="4a">
    In this problem, you will implement A* to speed up the search. Recall that in class,
    A* is just UCS with a different cost function (a new search problem), so we will
    implement A* via a <i>reduction</i> to UCS.
  <p>
    In particular, you should implement <code>aStarReduction()</code>
    which takes a search <code>problem</code> and a <code>heuristic</code> as input
    and returns a new search problem.
  </p>

  <div class="expected">
    An implementation of the <code>NewSearchProblem</code> class in the
    <code>aStarReduction(problem, heuristic)</code> function. As in prior problems, you need to implement
    <code>startState()</code>, <code>isEnd(state)</code>, and <code>actionSuccessorsAndCosts(state)</code>.
  </div>
</li>

<li class="code" id="4b">
  We are now ready to speed up search by simply implementing various heuristics.
  First, implement <code>StraightLineHeuristic</code> for Problem 2, which returns the
  straight line distance from a state to any location with the end tag.
  Note: you might want to precompute some things so that evaluating the heuristic is fast.

  <div class="expected">
    An implementation of the <code>StraightLineHeuristic</code> class.
  </div>
</li>

<li class="code" id="4c">
  Next, implement <code>NoWaypointsHeuristic</code> for Problem 3, which returns the minimum cost path from a state to
  any location with the end tag but ignoring all the waypoints (essentially the solution to Problem 2, so you can
  reuse that if you'd like). Note: you might want to precompute some things so that evaluating the heuristic is fast. 
  Helpful comments are provided in the code.

  <div class="expected">
    An implementation of the <code>NoWaypointsHeuristic</code> class.
  </div>

</li>

<li class="writeup" id="4d">
  Recall that heuristics are most effective when they are equal to the future cost.
  Consider an $n \times n$ grid map (<code>createGridMap</code>) where the start and end are at the opposite corners 
  and our action space is $\text{Actions}(s) = \{ (+1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, +1), (0, -1) \}$. For $n = 10$, we would have 
  <code>startLocation = "0,0"</code>, <code>endTag = "label=9,9"</code>.
  <p>
    If we remove the requirement to go through waypoints, this becomes the vanilla shortest path problem, which we
    can solve with UCS. However, running A* with the <code>NoWaypointsHeuristic</code> is different from running UCS 
    because the returned path will need to include the waypoints even though the heuristic ignores them. Provide a 
    concrete placement of $n$ <code>waypointTags</code> so that running A* with the <code>NoWaypointsHeuristic</code>
    has the same time complexity as running UCS.
